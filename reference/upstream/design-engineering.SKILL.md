Use with browser-iteration for implementation or interactive review of a rendered surface; animate, review-animations, and mobile-native stay focused lenses.

# Design engineering for Home

Home's craft standard for user-visible work, adapted from Emil Kowalski's design-engineering philosophy. `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ui-direction.md`, `docs/design-system.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/operating-manual.md`, Home's accessibility requirements, and the [browser-validation contract](../../../docs/browser-validation.md) always win; Jesse keeps approval authority. This skill adds judgment only — use Base UI-owned wrappers, Home tokens, and existing variants, and never introduce a second UI system, dependency, or demo route.

## Why craft compounds

- **Taste is trained.** Judgment is not personal preference. Study why existing Home surfaces and respected reference interfaces feel right, then apply that reading to the next decision.
- **Unseen details compound.** Users rarely name exact alignment, copy, timing, focus, or default-state behavior one by one. Their aggregate is the quality signal.
- **Beauty is product leverage.** A financial product earns trust through calm, cohesive correctness. Treat defaults and interaction feel as product work, not decoration.
- **Cohesion beats novelty.** Match the personality the surface already has. Extend existing tokens, variants, and contracts instead of inventing a parallel style.
- **Hierarchy is the job.** Every surface names one primary action, and everything else recedes.

## Working sequence

1. **Inspect the surface and its context.** Read the current component, its tokens, states, tests, and nearest established pattern before proposing anything. Reuse before replacing.
2. **Name hierarchy and default-state intent.** State the primary action, secondary actions, and the intended default, empty, loading, error, recovery, disabled, and focused states before editing.
3. **Review interaction edges.** Check press, focus-visible, keyboard, touch, capability-gated hover, long or translated content, partial data, slow or failed responses, and reduced motion — not only the happy path.
4. **Prefer the smallest cohesive improvement.** Improve the existing pattern rather than replacing it. A dependency, second component system, or demo route needs a separate approved decision. Keep Tailwind utilities inline at the product use site: do not detach them into class-string constants. Reusable presentation belongs in owned `components/ui` variants, and ESLint (`tailwind-policy/no-detached-class-constants`) rejects identifiers in `className`/`cn()` that resolve to local static class strings (see [design-system rules](../../../docs/design-system.md)).
5. **Validate at the applicable layer.** For implementation or interactive review of a rendered surface, follow the browser-validation contract and prove the production component in Home with the repository-pinned `agent-browser`, not a mock, a story, or a separately styled copy. Static or read-only diff review uses the available code and evidence without manufacturing a browser run.
6. **Review with fresh eyes.** For feel-dependent craft, replay the interaction slowly and revisit it later or the next day when the schedule allows; otherwise use a fresh reviewer. Working-state attention misses timing and detail problems that a reset can reveal.

## Motion

Purpose, frequency, and content sensitivity gate motion; `docs/ui-direction.md` sets the Home timing limits.

- **Purpose:** animate only for feedback, spatial continuity, state indication, or preventing a jarring change. "It looks cool" is not a purpose.
- **Frequency:** keyboard-initiated and repeatedly read actions stay instant or nearly imperceptible. Rare, deliberate moments can carry more expression.
- **Financial content:** frequently read balances, amounts, and positions stay still. Functional financial data does not move merely for decoration; motion belongs where it explains a real state change.
- **Timing:** tab ≤180ms, chip ≤120ms, CTA press 100–160ms. Other motion stays comparably short and optical, and reuses a nearby established curve rather than inventing one.
- **Properties:** prefer `transform` and `opacity`. Never `transition: all`, never enter from `scale(0)`, and take trigger-anchored origins from Base UI's transform-origin contract.
- **Reduced motion:** remove spatial and transform motion. Keep short opacity or color transitions only when they aid comprehension; never add a decorative fallback, and smooth scrolling stays `auto`.

`animate` implements this policy and `review-animations` reviews it. Both remain focused lenses, not alternate standards.

## Evidence and review

[UI PR previews](../../../docs/ui-pr-previews.md) is normative for visual proof.

- Screenshots use an adaptive comparison: pair Before and After only when the baseline materially improves judgment, with identical state, data, and CSS-pixel viewport and the current PR head as After. Otherwise keep current-head evidence only. Motion uses a short clip when stills cannot show behavior.
- Publish review findings separately from screenshots as `| Severity | Evidence | Judgment / action |`. Severity is blocker, major, or minor, and a taste-only note without concrete user or coherence impact is non-blocking.
- A Before/After table is screenshot evidence for comparable states, not a required shape for every review response; upstream's mandatory review format is not adopted.
- Keep the existing Storybook Before / Proposed / Implemented lifecycle; this skill creates no second evidence system.

## Report

Implementation reports name the changed surface, the hierarchy/default/edge states covered, and the `agent-browser` proof. When a PR records general design findings, use the table above; focused lenses keep their own evidence-bearing report formats. Never claim a check that was not performed.
